        <h2>Project Overview</h2>

            <p>This project was created, as my final psroject for my class, ASTR 1510 in Fall 2022. The goal was to present a topic, in a way chosen ourselves. I decided to create a website about Albert Einstein, presenting different categories, such as some famous theories of him and his life. </p>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li> 
                
                <li>Adobe XD</li>
                <li>GitHub Pages</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>

            <h3>1. Plan</h3>

                <p>The first step for this process was to create a webpage structure, I decided which pages I need, and how they would be connected. In this case, I decided to create 2 main categories, general information about Einstein's life and another one with some important theories. I decided to introduce his 3 most famous theories, theory of relativity, quantum physics, and photoelectric effect. I also created a separate page for the sources I used.</p>

            <h3>2. Design</h3>

                <p>I designed the website to have a nostalgic, 90s website or game feeling. That is a pit playful and has the feel of a game menu, to make the relatively boring subject matter more interesting.</p>

            <h3>3. Development</h3>

                    <p>For the design process, I started by creating the homepages HTML and CSS. After most of that was done, I applied the design to the other webpages, and adjusted where it was necessary. </p>

            <h3>4. Testing and Revision</h3>

                <p>After the website was functional, it was a little bit to boring for what I wanted to achieve, so to give the website an even more gamified look, I decided to also implement a cursor, and depending on the browser custom scrollbar. </p>

            <h3>5. Launch</h3>

                <p>I wanted to make the project accessible to my professor, so I decided to publish it with GitHub pages</p>
