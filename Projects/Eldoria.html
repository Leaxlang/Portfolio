        <h1>Eldoria</h1>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This is a text-based adventure game called Eldoria. The game was programmed in Java by me, as a class project for 
            CS 2013 - Programming with Data Structures. 
        </p>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Hashmap</li>
            <li>DialgueTree</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>

            <h3>1. Plan</h3>
            <p>
                After I had decided that I wanted the game to be set in a medival town and had decided what characters to include 
                and how to story would go. I presented it to my collegue who then started writing the dialogue. I prepared for the 
                development process by thinking about the structure of the program. Here I decided to use a DialogueTree that reads 
                in all the different DialogueNodes from a text file. And also to store the characters in a Hashmap that would get 
                read in from a text file as well. I also though about which methods I needed and how the player could win. 
            </p>

            <h3>2. Development</h3>
            <p>
                I started the development process with writing the DialogueTree and DialogueNodes data structures. After testing them, 
                and making sure they worked as intended. I continued with implementing the character hashmap. After they could be successfully
                be read in from the textfile, I continued linearly with the rest of the program. 
            </p>

            <h3>3. Validation</h3>
            <p>
                To validate the program and ensure that it was working properly I tested to program myself and had other people test it too.
                I fixed the bugs that were found, and repeated the step a few times until, everything was working smoothly. 
            </p>

            <h3>4. Evolution</h3>
            <p>
                For the future of the game, I can envision more characters and more dialogue options. And advancing the final game against the
                demon. This quest could also be just one in a whole row of quests to advance from a wizards apprentice to a full wizard. 
            </p>
