### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This is the repository for my Portfolio Website!

For this project I used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP

A big issue I faced during the creation of this website was to ensure that it would look good on all browsers. 

I learned the big lesson that cleaner code can help with cross browser compatibilty. And that really understanding your code is important, as it is much easier to fix issues. 

For the future I want to plan my code better to make it cleaner and easier to understand (by myself too). So that the structure makes it also easier to debug.
