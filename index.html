        <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
        <p>
          For my final project in ASTR 1510, I decided to create a website about Albert Einstein.
          I used HTML to structure the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
          This combination allowed me to present information about Einstein in an engaging and
          interactive manner. HTML organized the content, CSS enhanced the visuals, and JavaScript
          added interactive elements, making my project informative and visually appealing.

      About
    </h2>

    <h3>üëãHelloüëã</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Lea and I am Frontend Engineer. I currently am a student
      at the California State University Los Angeles where I get my Bachelors
      in Graphic Communications. I am also minoring in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <h3>üå±Clubs and Engagementüå±</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, I serve as the web manager for my school's Society of Women Engineers chapter and hold the role of a
      resident assistant, fostering community and student well-being. My participation extends to academic and
      tech-related clubs, including ACM and Google Student Developer Club, where I delve into the ever-evolving world of
      technology and innovation. My commitment to positive change is further underscored by my prior position as Vice
      President of the Environmental Policy Committee within the Student Government, where I advocated for sustainable
      practices and environmental awareness on campus.
    </p>
    <h3> üìùMy Storyüìù</h3>
    <p>
      My journey into web development started at a young age. When I was just 12 years old, I built a small website
      comprising three HTML files to celebrate my best friend's birthday. This experience ignited my fascination with
      web development, and I've been on an exciting path of exploration and learning ever since. Today, I'm thrilled to
      combine my technical skills and creative passion to craft meaningful online experiences.
