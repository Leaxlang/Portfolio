        <p>
          This project was my Senior Design Project; we decided to make a clothing e-commerce store that would sell sci-fi-themed clothing. 
          For this project, I was the development group leader and head developer, which meant I assigned tasks to my team, managed the Github,
           and ensured we stayed on track. We used React and Remix, as well as CSS. </br></br>
           We used Shopify‚Äôs Headless e-commerce framework to build a completely custom experience while being functional and fully operational.

            This project is a collection of diverse elements and challenges, all meticulously crafted using

        <p>
          For my final project in ASTR 1510, I decided to create a website about Albert Einstein.
          I used HTML to structure the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
          This combination allowed me to present information about Einstein in an engaging and
          interactive manner. HTML organized the content, CSS enhanced the visuals, and JavaScript
          added interactive elements, making my project informative and visually appealing.

        This was my final project for the class CS 2013 - Programming with Data Structures. It's a text-based
        adventure game, telling the story of the medival town of Eldoria, that is haunted by an evil demon. 
        The game was create with Java. My role was coding of the game, while I had support in writing the dialogue.</br>
        I coded a custom data structure for his project that would allow me to easily change and edit dialogue 
        nodes in the future while being able to have branching storylines and different endings to the story.

    <h2>
      About
    </h2>

    <h3>üëãHelloüëã</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Lea and I am Frontend Engineer. I graduate from California State Univeristy Los Angeles with a Bachelors 
      in Graphic Communications, and a minor in Computer Science.
      I like making web applications and learning new technologies. 
  </br>
    When I'm not sitting behind my laptop and coding, you can probably find me in the garden. I'm passionate about 
    taking care of plants, and I really enjoy eating them. There's nothing better than some fresh garden veggies on the dinner plate. 
    Being outdoors is fun, I like hiking and kayaking, there's always an adventure to be found. 
    </p>
    <h3>üå±Societies and Engagementüå±</h3>
    <p>
      During my school time I served as the web manager for my school's Society of Women Engineers chapter and hold the role of a
      resident assistant in student housing. I was also the member of other technology clubs, including ACM and Google Student 
      Developer Club, always trying to learn more. My commitment to positive change is further underscored by my prior position as Vice
      President of the Environmental Policy Committee within the Student Government, where I advocated for sustainable
      practices and environmental awareness on campus.
    </p>
    <h3> üìùMy Storyüìù</h3>
    <p>
      My journey into web development started at a young age. When I was just 12 years old, I built a small website
      comprising three HTML files to celebrate my best friend's birthday. This experience ignited my fascination with
      web development, and I've been on an exciting path of exploration and learning ever since. Today, I'm thrilled to
      combine my technical skills and creative passion to craft meaningful online experiences.
