          <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
          <p>
            For my final project in ASTR 1510, I decided to create a website about Albert Einstein. 
            I used HTML to structure the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. 
            This combination allowed me to present information about Einstein in an engaging and 
            interactive manner. HTML organized the content, CSS enhanced the visuals, and JavaScript 
            added interactive elements, making my project informative and visually appealing.

            For our senior design project me and my 5 other group members decided to

                And also designing the clothes that would be presented. 
                My role in this project was the management of the website, where I delegated tasks and check work of 2,3 other team members.

        My name is Lea and I am Frontend Engineer. I currently am a student
        at the California State University Los Angeles where I get my Bachelors
        in Graphic Communications. I am also minoring in Computer Science.

      <p>
        Currently, I serve as the web manager for my school's Society of Women Engineers chapter and hold the role of a resident assistant, fostering community and student well-being. My participation extends to academic and tech-related clubs, including ACM and Google Student Developer Club, where I delve into the ever-evolving world of technology and innovation. My commitment to positive change is further underscored by my prior position as Vice President of the Environmental Policy Committee within the Student Government, where I advocated for sustainable practices and environmental awareness on campus.

       <h3> üìùMy Storyüìù</h3>
       <p>
        My journey into web development started at a young age. When I was just 12 years old, I built a small website comprising three HTML files to celebrate my best friend's birthday. This experience ignited my fascination with web development, and I've been on an exciting path of exploration and learning ever since. Today, I'm thrilled to combine my technical skills and creative passion to craft meaningful online experiences.
